This website is intended for personal use to reflect the projects that I have worked on, and to give contact information for those interested.

The website is not in a 'finished' state as there are a few ideas that I have in mind to implement. Additionally, it will continue to evolve as I continue working on different projects that will be added to this page. 

If you are interested in my work, then please bookmark my site and follow me on LinkedIn. 

The bones of this website were constructed by the YouTube video linked below:
